# Compound :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Compound is a project for tracking habits and recurring events. The idea is using a simple interface to log your progress on a some defined basis, and then use that data to make better routines overtime to compound purposeful growth.

## Monorepo Structure :open_file_folder:

This monorepo hosts several essential parts of the Compound ecosystem:

- `frontend`: The web-based user interface for interacting with Compound.
- `backend`: Currently this just holds my dev supabase directory for creating a MVP of this project. This will be potentially be replaced with a more robust backend in the future.
- `wiki`: (Upcoming) The knowledge base containing all the documentation and guides for using Compound.
- `mobile`: (Upcoming) The mobile version of the Compound app for tracking habits on the go.
